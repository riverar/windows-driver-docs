The driver will perform a query for the logical block range specified and checks if it is included in storage spaces dirty range tracking. The synchronization status of the range is returned in the **OperationStatus** member of the [**DEVICE\_MANAGE\_DATA\_SET\_ATTRIBUTES\_OUTPUT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439656) structure.

The logical block range is specified, on input, in a single [**DEVICE\_DATA\_SET\_RANGE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552523) structure.

> [!Note]
> Supported in Windows 8 and later versions of Windows.

The driver will clear dirty range status for the for the logical block range specified.

The logical block range is specified in a single [**DEVICE\_DATA\_SET\_RANGE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552523) structure.

> [!Note]
> Supported in Windows 8 and later versions of Windows.

<span id="DeviceDsmAction_DrtDisable"></span><span id="devicedsmaction_drtdisable"></span><span id="DEVICEDSMACTION_DRTDISABLE"></span>**DeviceDsmAction\_DrtDisable**
(10 | DeviceDsmActionFlag\_NonDestructive)

(14 | DeviceDsmActionFlag\_NonDestructive)
The driver will change the caching priority of specified ranges of logical blocks.

The new target priority is set in a **DEVICE\_DSM\_NVCACHE\_CHANGE\_PRIORITY\_PARAMETERS** structure which is located at **ParameterBlockOffset** in [**DEVICE\_MANAGE\_DATA\_SET\_ATTRIBUTES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552527). The logical block ranges to change priority for are given in one or more [**DEVICE\_DATA\_SET\_RANGE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552523) structures.

The **DEVICE\_DSM\_NVCACHE\_CHANGE\_PRIORITY\_PARAMETERS** is defined in *ntddstor.h* and has the following members:

<span id="Size"></span><span id="size"></span><span id="SIZE"></span>Size  
Size of this structure. Set to **sizeof**(DEVICE\_DSM\_NVCACHE\_CHANGE\_PRIORITY\_PARAMETERS).

<span id="TargetPriority"></span><span id="targetpriority"></span><span id="TARGETPRIORITY"></span>TargetPriority  
The new target priority for the logical block ranges given.

<span id="Resrved_3_"></span><span id="resrved_3_"></span><span id="RESRVED_3_"></span>Resrved\[3\]  
Reserved bytes.

> Supported in Windows 8.1 and later versions of Windows.

<span id="DeviceDsmAction_NvCache_Evict"></span><span id="devicedsmaction_nvcache_evict"></span><span id="DEVICEDSMACTION_NVCACHE_EVICT"></span>**DeviceDsmAction\_NvCache\_Evict**
(15 | DeviceDsmActionFlag\_NonDestructive)
The driver will evict data from the caching medium. To evict all data, set the DEVICE\_DSM\_FLAG\_ENTIRE\_DATA\_SET\_RANGE flag in the **Flags** member of [**DEVICE\_MANAGE\_DATA\_SET\_ATTRIBUTES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552527) and do not include any [**DEVICE\_DATA\_SET\_RANGE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552523) structures.

Specific logical block ranges to evict are given in one or more [**DEVICE\_DATA\_SET\_RANGE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552523) structures.

The **DeviceDsmAction\_NvCache\_Evict** action is executed synchronously. No other actions are serviced until the evict action has either succeeded or failed. In order to limit its impact on applications using the device, each **DeviceDsmAction\_NvCache\_Evict** action issued should include relatively small data ranges. They should not exceed 10 MB and ideally be smaller than 2 MB. This will minimize the chance that user level applications will experience noticeable delays when accessing data on the device.

> [!Note]
> Supported in Windows 8.1 and later versions of Windows. 

Remarks
-------

If a bitwise **OR** of the **DEVICE\_DATA\_MANAGEMENT\_SET\_ACTION** constant value and the **DeviceDsmActionFlag\_NonDestructive** flag is performed, the specified action is nondestructive. If this flag is set, the driver can safely forward the [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_MANAGE\_DATA\_SET\_ATTRIBUTES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560573) request to the next lower driver in the stack even if the driver does not handle the specified action.

> [!Note]
> Before it forwards the [**IOCTL_STORAGE_MANAGE_DATA_SET_ATTRIBUTES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560573) request, the driver still performs the normal processing of the block of data set ranges that are specified in the [**DEVICE_MANAGE_DATA_SET_ATTRIBUTES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552527) structure. This block is located at **DataSetRangesOffset** and consists of one or more contiguous entries formatted as [**DEVICE_DATA_SET_RANGE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552523) structures. The length, in bytes, of the data set ranges is set in the **DataSetRangesLength** member of **DEVICE_MANAGE_DATA_SET_ATTRIBUTES**.
